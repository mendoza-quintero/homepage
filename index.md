# Edrea Mendoza Quintero

I am a History PhD Candidate at the University of New Mexico. My research focuses on Latin American history, specifically women and reproductive rights in Mexico during the 1970s and 1980s. My other interests include Cold War history in Latin America, gender history, social movements, and US-Latin American relations. This page will have all the cool stuff I am working on or have created.
