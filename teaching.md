summary: I believe successful teaching is a combination of student-led activities and comprehensive and engaging lectures that supplement course materials. Readings, lectures, primary source materials, along with individual and group work should come together to create a complete picture of the history being taught. This allows students to have multiple avenues with which to interact with the people, places, and events they are learning about. Assessment should be equally varied so students can find the ways they learn most succesfully and use those tools to succeed.

## How I Approach Teaching

I believe that the lecture remains one of the most powerful tools for communicating knowledge. A well-crafted lecture allows an instructor to synthesize complex ideas, trace intellectual lineages, and model expert thinking in ways that students might struggle to discover on their own. By guiding learners through a structured, coherent narrative, a lecture can create clarity and momentum, sparking curiosity while ensuring that foundational knowledge is presented accurately and efficiently. The lecture hall is also a space where students can witness passion and intellectual rigor in real time â€” an opportunity to observe not just what scholars know, but how they think.

Lectures shouold serve as the jumping off point for the ideas and history that will be further covered by readings, primary source analysis, writing activities, and other expressions of knowledge. Assignments, projects, examinations, and writing activities should allow students to connect with course materials in meaningful ways that also reflect the world around them. Group work should be encouraged, not compulsory, to help foster community in the classroom and aid in building students' ability to collaborate with different types of people. For students who need a more individualistic approach to their work, encouraging the use of resources such as meetings with librarians or other students working individually to compare ideas and approaches can still help to foster community and encourage collaboration in different ways.
