summary: My research investigates how digital technology can reimagine public history and expand access to cultural heritage. I focus on virtual museums, interactive 3D reconstructions, and community-driven archives in the U.S. Southwest and borderlands. By integrating data visualization, GIS mapping, and ethical digitization practices, I aim to craft historical narratives that are both inclusive and engaging for diverse audiences.

## Research Interests

My research explores Mexican family planning initiatives that gained traction beginning in the early 1970s. By examining national sex education programs, contraceptive use and access, and the abortion decriminalization debates that were happening at this time, I work to understand how women and their reproductive capabilities were at the forefront of populaton control measures in Mexico in the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, examining not just the policies themselves but how and where they were rolled out and how Mexican women responded to these seemingly progressive reforms, allows us to see how the government's concern was less on women and their bodily autonomy and more on lowering dependence on social welfare so Mexico's economy could grow in a way that would elevate it as a global power.

My scholarship also reflects a strong commitment to pedagogy and public engagement. I investigate how digital literacy and humanistic computing can be used to empower students and local communities to participate actively in preserving and interpreting history. Through my conference presentations, publications, and collaborative workshops, I highlight the potential of emerging technologies, such as GIS mapping, augmented reality, and interactive exhibits, to reframe histories of migration, identity, and place.
