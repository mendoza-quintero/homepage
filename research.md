summary: My research focuses on federal population control policies as they relate to reproduction in Mexico during the 1970s and 1980s. I examine national sex education programss (which I define broadly to include public information campaigns), the federal finding of contraceotives access, and the debates happening at this time to consider decriminalizing abortion.

My research explores Mexican family planning initiatives that gained traction beginning in the early 1970s. By examining national sex education programs, contraceptive use and access, and the abortion decriminalization debates that were happening at this time, I work to understand how women and their reproductive capabilities were at the forefront of populaton control measures in Mexico in the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, examining not just the policies themselves but how and where they were rolled out and how Mexican women responded to these seemingly progressive reforms, allows us to see how the government's concern was less on women and their bodily autonomy and more on lowering dependence on social welfare so Mexico's economy could grow in a way that would elevate it as a global power.
